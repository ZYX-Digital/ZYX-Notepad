ZYX Notepad is more than just a simple text editor; it's a powerful, persistent, and private workspace designed to live directly in your browser. Whether you're a developer needing a scratchpad, a writer drafting ideas, or just someone who needs to jot down notes quickly, ZYX Notepad is built to be your reliable digital companion.
Your Data & Privacy
Private and Persistent Storage

All your notes, tabs, and settings are saved only to your browser's localStorage. This means your data is private to you and never sent to a server.

Because your data is saved to a persistent file on your hard drive (managed by the browser), your work will survive a reboot of your computer. When you reopen this page, your notes will load exactly as you left them.
Important Warnings:

    How Data Can Be Lost: Your data will be permanently lost if you:
        Manually clear your browser's cache, cookies, or "site data."
        Switch to a different browser (e.g., notes in Chrome won't appear in Firefox).
    Private/Incognito Mode:
        In a private window, your text will survive a page refresh or reload.
        However, all data will be permanently erased the moment you close the private window or tab.

Key Features

    Dynamic Split-Views: Organize your workspace with up to three split views. You can now rename any split by clicking its label.
    Smart Tab Management: Create, rename, and close tabs freely. If you close a Split View, your open tabs are automatically migrated to the remaining view so you never lose your work.
    Global Search: Instantly find what you're looking for. The search bar scans the content of all your tabs across all your splits and shows you exactly where your text is.
    Built-in Tools Panel: Slide out the "Tools" panel (using the smart side-arrow) for quick access to:
        A Standard Calculator (with full numpad support).
        A Random Text Generator (for placeholders and passwords).
        A Special Characters tool to easily find and copy unicode symbols.
        Links to Full Calculator, DNS Info, and other external apps.
    Offline-Ready: You can download a fully offline version of this page. Click More > Download Offline to save the application HTML file to your device.
    Action History: Access the history panel using the side-arrow to view recent copy, cut, and delete actions, allowing you to retrieve text you thought was lost.
    Full Customization:
        Light & Dark Mode: Switch between a clean light theme or a sleek, eye-friendly dark mode.
        Font Control: Adjust the font family and font size to find your perfect reading environment.
    Notepad Utilities: Each editor panel is packed with features, including:
        Live Word Count
        Synchronized Line Numbers
        A "Save as TXT" button to download your current tab.
        A toggle for browser spellcheck.
    Share Your Layout: The "Get Share URL" button creates a unique link that saves your current theme, font settings, and split-screen layout.

Responsive Mobile Layout

This application is fully responsive and designed to work great on mobile. On smaller screens, the layout adapts:

    The main controls collapse into a convenient hamburger menu (☰).
    The "More" menu and its options are flattened for easy, one-tap access.
    Split-screen views will automatically stack vertically so you can scroll through your notes.
